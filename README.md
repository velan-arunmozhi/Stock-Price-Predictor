# Stock-Price-Predictor
This project uses a LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model to predict the next-day closing prices of stocks. 

Note: This is the initial version of my project. I want to improve upon the model so that it better follows the stock price than creating a general trend. I will update this README with more detailed information when I have implemented these changes and/or make further progress.
